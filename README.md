# MapleChat - Communication withing a Web Project Team LIA
MapleChat Landing Page is a simple responsive website built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to promote and later provide downloads for the MapleChat mobile app, a Canada-only messaging service where all user data is stored within Canada.

## Project overview

MapleChat is a concept messenger app designed exclusively for users in Canada, with a strong focus on privacy and data residency (all data remains on Canadian servers).
This repository contains a single-page marketing site that presents the app’s key features, explains its Canada-first approach, and provides a future section for app store download links.

## Features

- Responsive layout using Bootstrap so the page looks good on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Hero section describing MapleChat, highlighting that it is a Canadian-only messenger with data stored in Canada.
- Sections for features, screenshots/placeholders, FAQ, and future download buttons (Google Play, App Store, etc.) to be added later. 

## Technologies used

- HTML5 for the page structure and semantic content. 
- CSS3 for custom styling and branding on top of Bootstrap.
- Bootstrap (via CDN) for grid layout, components, and basic responsive design utilities. 

## Getting started

- Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
- Open index.html directly in your browser, or use a simple static server such as the “Live Server” extension in VS Code.
- Ensure your internet connection is available if you are loading Bootstrap from a CDN.

## Project structure

- index.html – main landing page for MapleChat with all sections.
- /css – custom stylesheet(s) for additional styles and theme (e.g., maple leaf / Canada-inspired colors).
- /assets (optional) – folder for images, logos, and mockup screenshots of the app UI.

## Usage

- Use this page to showcase the MapleChat concept for a college assignment or portfolio.
- Replace placeholder text, icons, and images with your own MapleChat branding, screenshots, and real store links when the app is ready.

## Roadmap

- Add working download buttons linked to the iOS and Android app stores once the MapleChat app is published.
- Expand the FAQ and privacy sections to describe how user messages stay in Canada and how data protection is handled.
- Integrate simple contact or newsletter signup form to collect interested users’ emails for launch announcements.
